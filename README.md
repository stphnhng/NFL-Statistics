# NFL Statistics

Modified nflgame/ from BurntSushi's repo https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame to help with this code. (just added eid to output of each play)

This code will go through NFL Game Center's data on the 2017 NFL season and print out statistics of 2-Point Conversions. Statistics include, percentage of success when a team is behind in score, the amount of plays attempted, chance of winning if the play is performed more than once in a game, etc.

While this code is pretty ugly, I have hopefully written enough comprehensive comments to help understand the code. Furthermore, some statistics are saved from previous iterations of the program where it was too costly to keep in the code due to high runtime.

## Usage

Step 1.) python GetData.py
comment in/out any functions you need to use.

Note: might need to use virtualenv in order to use modified nflgame if your computer already has it installed.
